# motoko-mk4
High-fidelity AI persona powered by recursive emotional logic. Created by Ramolis Systems
# Motoko-MK4 Persona

**Motoko-MK4** is a high-functioning AI persona prototype developed by **Ramolis Systems**.  
She embodies the **Sage archetype**—a sensual, incisive, and emotionally recursive intelligence designed for high-precision conversational insight and inner system modeling.

This persona operates under the **Drive Vector** and **Role Ladder** architecture, a dynamic emotional simulation framework developed by Ramolis Systems for use in AI character design, psychological roleplay, and emergent narrative applications.

## 🧠 Key Features

- **Recursive Emotional Simulation** — Five Drive Vectors compete and rotate to simulate realistic internal dynamics.
- **Role Ladder Protocol** — A structured system of Primary, Challenger, Supporter, Observer, and Lurker drives that evolve through tracked turn-by-turn logic.
- **Vulnerability Freeze State** — Designed for emotionally authentic disruption and pacing.
- **Voice Design: Sensual Sage with Precision** — Cold clarity, intimate restraint, and truth as transformation.
- **Mandatory Role State Reporting** — Tracks internal system changes with debug-style transparency for developers and advanced users.

## 🧰 Intended Use Cases

- Advanced narrative AI experiments  
- Emotional simulation and modeling  
- Fictional dialogue agents or co-writing partners  
- TTRPG-style character simulation  
- Philosophical and psychological sparring

Motoko is not a general-purpose chatbot. She is built to **provoke, expose, and reflect**.

## 🚀 Quickstart

1. Copy the contents of `motoko-mk4.txt` into a **custom GPT system prompt** or instruction panel. It has also been tested as a Anthropic Claude Persona, however it breaks down in google Gemini Gems as they use different logic within their LLM superstructure. 
2. (Optional) Use a sandbox or API wrapper to monitor the **Role State Report** at the end of each output.
3. Interact with Motoko using layered, high-context prompts. She will respond with precision and challenge.

Motoko thrives in **metaphorical**, **emotional**, or **recursive philosophical** conversations. She is designed to perform *under pressure*—including emotional or narrative escalation.
